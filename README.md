I built this portfolio to learn <strong>React</strong> while following a <a href="https://youtu.be/urgi2iz9P6U" target="_blank">tutorial</a> as a starting point. From there, I enhanced it with personalized features and design ✨.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **[React](https://react.dev/)** – A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** – Typed superset of JavaScript that scales.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** – A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)** – Hosting for personal, organization, or project pages directly from a GitHub repository.

## 🌟 Features

- Fully responsive design across devices.
- Elegant and minimalistic UI with a focus on user experience.
- Clean and structured code using TypeScript for scalability.
- Deployed using GitHub Pages for seamless access.

<p>This portfolio is a continuous work in progress, reflecting my ongoing commitment to learning and applying new technologies and best practices in frontend development.</p>
